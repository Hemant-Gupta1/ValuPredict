# ValuPredict

# Project Description

This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Ridge regression and polynomial regression to predict the target variable 'Label' from a dataset with features related to a classification or regression task. By employing techniques like Ridge regression, polynomial feature transformation, and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, the model's performance was significantly improved from 39.632% accuracy to 98.391% accuracy. The project follows the end-to-end data science workflow, including data cleaning, feature engineering, outlier detection, and model optimization.


# How to Run

    Clone the repository or download the files.
    Place your train.csv and test.csv files in the same directory as the project script.
    Run the code in your preferred Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, PyCharm).
# Project Workflow
1. Data Loading

The project begins by loading the train.csv and test.csv datasets using pandas.read_csv(). These datasets contain the features needed for training and predicting the target variable 'Label'.
2. Data Cleaning

Several cleaning steps are performed to ensure the data is ready for modeling:

    Handling Missing Values: Missing values in the features Feature1 and Feature4 are filled with the mean values of these respective features.
    Handling Duplicates: Duplicate entries in the training dataset are dropped.
    Outlier Removal: Outliers are identified using Z-scores and removed from the training data. This ensures that the model is not skewed by extreme values.
3. Data Visualization

To better understand the relationships between features, the following visualizations are generated:

    Pairplot: This visualizes the pairwise relationships between the features and the target variable.
    Correlation Heatmap: A heatmap is created to display the correlation between features.
4. Model Building

The model uses Ridge Regression, a regularized linear regression model that reduces overfitting by adding a penalty for large coefficients.

    Feature Selection: The features used in the model are Feature1, Feature2, Feature3, and Feature4. The boolean feature Feature2 is converted to an integer for model compatibility.
    Pipeline: A pipeline is constructed to perform scaling, polynomial feature generation, and Ridge regression.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning

GridSearchCV is used to perform cross-validation and tune the hyperparameters of the Ridge regression model. The model is evaluated using the RÂ² score.

By applying this technique along with polynomial regression, the model's accuracy was significantly improved from 39.632% to 98.391%.

6. Testing and Prediction

The best model from GridSearchCV is used to predict the 'Label' for the test data, and the results are saved to a CSV file named submission.csv.

# Conclusion

This project showcases a complete workflow for building a machine learning model, from data preprocessing and visualization to model tuning and testing. By applying techniques such as Ridge regression, polynomial regression, and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, the model's accuracy was improved from 39.632% to 98.391%. The final model is used to generate predictions on test data and save them in a CSV file for further evaluation.
